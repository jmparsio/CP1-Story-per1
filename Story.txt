I woke up and got dressed
I ate
I brushed my teeth
I took the algebra exit exam
I went to 4th period and took the EOY
I went to lunch and ate
For some reason someone brought terot cards
I went to math where we played uno because we took the test in the morning  
And here we are

3. World Studies

5. Lunch
